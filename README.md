# ResonantUltrasoundSpectroscopy.jl

Partial translation of [PALab/RUS](https://github.com/PALab/RUS/) into the Julia language, because the Python code is slow and the C code is unbearable.

The precompilation is a little crude at this stage, but this code is already at least an order of magnitude faster than the python version.

This package is not intended to be added as an official Julia package. So, to install it, use the github url:

```julia
] add "https://github.com/s-henao-castellanos/ResonantUltrasoundSpectroscopy.jl.git"
```
